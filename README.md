# GAN

 - Using MNIST dataset from keras library, to create a generative adversial network, that will create copies of the images from the dataset using machine learning.
 
 What is going on in a *Generative Adversial Network* is that we are using a dataset of images and we are going to be using that as our officer, then we are going to create a bot that will at first generate white noise, and over time our white noise will evolve into something that looks very similar to the images we have in our officer dataset. Primitavely, we're using our bot to try to fool our officer into thinking our white noise is the real deal. Selling a believable fake if you will.
